# Welcome to my Github profile



## Hello ! ![wave](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png)



 ## My name is Rachid and I'm starting a very exciting career as a Devops Cloud Engineer. During the containment I realised how important Cloud Computing has become for companies. Thus, I decided to take this opportunity to change the direction I want to take for the rest of my career...One thing is for sure, I'll always learn new things, I'll never get bored any more



-   ![telescope](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f52d.png) I am currently working on **Microsoft Azure** using many techniques such as Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Docker, Kunernetes etc... The Cloud is such an ocean, there is so much to learn, let's dive in, let's always learn, that's my motto.
   
-   ![wrench](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f527.png)I love learning new languages, currently working with  **Python**,  **JavaScript**,  **Typscript**, **C#**, **SQL**, **NOSQL**...

-   ![zap](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a1.png) Fun fact: I have a background in accounting and finance where I was always bored. I finally found my way when I started programming during containment. A new professional life is starting, a rebirth.
